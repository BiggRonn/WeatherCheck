# WeatherCheck
Basic weather application that will give current weather in a city and a 5 day forecast and save previous searches.

This app is a demonstration on basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Design understanding. I wanted to make it serve the basic function of telling you current weather and a 5day forecast for a particular city effectively in both mobile and desktop screen sizes. Right now, the MVP I have here works well and displays information clearly, that is great. There are many features I could add in the future, although I plan to move on to more complex projects for now.

## Future Developments

-Display more information that is available to us from the API, especially in Desktop sizes. We can see from the example API calls below that there is a lot of information that we are not using that is easily accessible.

-More elegant design/flashy elements

-Better Icons-the icons we are displaying are from the onecallAPI and look pretty bad. We could easily use some online icons or images or even custom css to give us better looking clouds and sun etc.
